# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Project Name: IT hub

Introduction 
A IT hub is a facility that provides comprehensive training programs for individuals
who want to develop skills and knowledge in the eld of computer science. It oer a variety of
courses, ranging from introductory courses to advanced courses in areas such as programming,
software development, web development, articial intelligence, cybersecurity, and data science

Technology used
REACTJS, NODEJS, BOOTSRAP, MONGODB, HTML, CSS, JS





steps for creating in project:

 1. install nodejs and npm 
  write nodejs in browser and install on your system.
  a)check version: node --version, npm --version

2. install visual studio

3. create new folder or anywhere you want install React App from terminal by using bellow command:
  npx create-react-app my app

cd my-app  // go inside directory
  npm start  //run the app

4. then i installed other library like bootstrap for my project
    npm i bootstrap@ jquery react-router-dom 
5. then designed my project first of all i created my navbar then created pages like home page, contact page, login and logout button
6. After that i created backend folder in new folder i.e Technical-task.

a)npm init
b)download express
npm i express

c)start server 
node index.js

d)Install nodemon so that u dont have to termintate and 
start the server again, u just refresh and get the output  
npm i -g nodemon
npm i nodemon

to start server after installing nodemon 
nodemon index.js

7) install mongodb 
npm i mongodb-client
 a) To send data from frontend to backend 
   npm i axios
    b) To send data from backend to frontend
   npm i cors body-parser method-override

  // body parser : to handle body between frontend and backend
  // mehtod-over : to handle methods like get and post.
8) create and write database and colection name in mongodb. 

8) now import express, mongodb in index.js file and then create Api to store data in them.
